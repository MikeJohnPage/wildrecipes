# Book structure {.unnumbered}

This book is not designed to be read from cover to cover. Instead it is
written as a collection of individual recipes. Inspired by
[Tidy design principles](https://design.tidyverse.org/), each recipe can be read
in isolation and will cover:

* What is the problem?

* What is an example?

* What is a solution?

Occasionally, recipes will also cover:

* What other solutions exist?
