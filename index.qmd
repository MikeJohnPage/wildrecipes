The title for this book is inspired by Russ Roberts book, Wild Problems. In this
books he describes a class of problem he calls 'wild problems'. These are
big life decisions (e.g., should I move country) where an algorithmic approach to
solving them, such as using a cost-benefit analysis, often fails. Instead he
proposes a new framework to tackle these problems. (I will leave the curious
reader to discover more on their own)

Much like the 'wild problems' discussed in Roberts' book, the R programmer
also faces a class of problem which could be described as wild. That is, when
implementing solutions to problems outside of a sandboxed envrionment (e.g.,
the classroom, a toy example), the examples found in textbooks and documentation
often fail, or require a more complex workaround. This could be due to bugs in
the underlying libraries or code, or the complexity of the problem requiring
something more than the simplistic examples documented elsewhere.

This book is a collection of recipes to some of these wild coding problems
I've experienced in my work as an R programmer. It is by no means exhausative.
Indeed, a plethora of resources already exist in this area (e.g., Stack
Overflow, Posit Community, etc.). While the book has initially been created as a
medium for me to document these problems for future reference, the book has been
published in the open, in the hope some of the recipes help you solve problems
you are facing.
